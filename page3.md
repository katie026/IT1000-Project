## Captivity
Bears are kept in captivity for a plethora of reasons. Some for _protection_ (for better or worse) and some for _entertainment_. Let's take a closer look.
#### Circuses & Shows
Bears are still used in performances like circuses.They are often kept in improper living spaces that are too small and are not given enough exercise. They are often carted around and subject to change in ownership. It was said that during training, the bears are often injured or simply by accident.

#### Zoos
Bears are also kept in zoos. I would guess you have visited at last even one. These are controversial captives, as they are not often given proper care and living standards. Not only are the conditions hard, the life style is stressful and the constant observation and proximity to a crowd weighs on the animal's mental health. However, some people say that captivity of a few are important to increase wildlife conservation support by creating a connection to the public.

Here are a list of possible side effects of captivity:
* likely to exhibit neurotic behaviors:
  * pacing
  * walking in circles
  * rolling or bobbing their heads
  * swaying from side to side, which zoo visitors often misinterpret as “dancing.”
